We host weekly tournaments for melee as well as larger tournaments every once in a while, for a variety of smash games. We encourage everyone to come out and play, we have some spare controllers if you don't have any. Learn, play, win!</p>

<h2>What is Melee and Project M?</h2>

<p>Super Smash Bros. Melee (Japanese: 大乱闘だいらんとうスマッシュブラザーズDXデラックス Hepburn: Dairantō Sumasshu Burazāzu Derakkusu?, lit. "Great Melee Smash Brothers DX", with "DX" pronounced as "deluxe"), often abbreviated as SSBM or simply as Melee, is a crossover fighting game released for the Nintendo GameCube shortly after its launch in 2001 (2002 in the PAL region). It is the second game in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the first game released for Nintendo 64 in 1999. HAL Laboratory developed the game, with Masahiro Sakurai as head of production.</p>

<p>The game features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox and Pokémon. Melee includes all playable characters from the first game in the series on the Nintendo 64, but it also adds new characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside of Japan at the time. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from, popular games released by Nintendo. Melee‍ '​s gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with percentages, rather than the health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments and is still the most popular Smash title for competitive play.</p>

<p>Project M is a community-made mod of Brawl inspired by Super Smash Bros. Melee's gameplay designed to add rich, technical gameplay to a balanced cast of characters while additionally enhancing the speed of play. Project M employs new codes which seamlessly add in new, universal features to the entire cast to add technical variety to all characters.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the main aspects of Super Smash Bros. Melee that inspired and have carried over into Project M:</p>

<p><ul><li><h5><strong>1.</strong> A fast-paced game</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>2.</strong> with flowing, natural movement</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>3.</strong> where the player has a great degree of control over their character due to the technical skill that they've achieved.</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>4.</strong> The balance of offense and defense changes depending on the exact matchup and playstyle, but overall tends to favor offense slightly.</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>5.</strong> Offstage edgeguarding is risky but rewarding, while on-stage edgeguarding is safer but less rewarding.</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>6.</strong> Recoveries generally require great skill to use, with the advantage usually being with the edgeguarding player, with some exceptions.</h5></li>
<li><h5><strong>7.</strong> The combos are challenging and spontaneous, with anything longer than 2-3 hits requiring a knowledge of both characters' options and some degree of prediction and/or a deep understanding of the mental aspect of the game.</h5></li>
</ul></p>
