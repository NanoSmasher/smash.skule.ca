Melee League Season 2. A month long best of 5 series split into four divisions.

The bells have rung, all bets are in. Season 2 of the melee league is finally over! Congratulations to N0z1ck, Alex, MILK, and Mr. Potatobread, your first place finishers! (I for one welcome our new 1T9 overlords) Full results in the comments. 
Pit smash returns this monday, and 2 big 2 blue coming up soon! Look forward to the crew battles!
I hope everyone had fun with the league and learned a lot. Think about the stages you got to play on, and come back even smarter next time!
I want to thank everyone for being really good with activity. We only had 2 matches not completed (out of 180!!!), not counting the DQ.
