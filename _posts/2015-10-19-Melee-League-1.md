Melee League Season 1. A month long best of 5 series split into two divisions.

Final results from season 1 of the melee league! Thanks to everyone for playing your matches and I hope you all had fun. In Div 1 Nozick had a bit of a rough week and ended up ceding the lead in standings to Johnny and Dances with Pidgeons, but still ended with an impressive win ratio. Props go to Tiggz and Duck Chris for being the only ones to play every single match assigned. In Div 2 NoMain reigns supreme, with Archaene and Wobbaduck rounding out the top 3. Slops to all the people that dropped out but that'll be cleaned up next time.

Season 2 of the Melee League will launch January 2016.
